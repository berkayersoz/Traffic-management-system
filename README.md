# Smart Traffic Management System Using OMNeT++ and FLoRa

## üö¶ Overview
This project simulates a smart traffic management system designed to optimize traffic light control at a crossroad intersection using OMNeT++ and the FLoRa framework. The goal is to minimize vehicle wait times and congestion by dynamically adjusting traffic lights based on real-time sensor data.

Camera sensors placed at each road detect the number of waiting vehicles. This data is sent via LoRa (Long Range) communication to a central Control Unit (CU), which determines the optimal traffic light changes. The simulation models realistic vehicle behavior and network performance using stochastic processes such as Poisson distribution and Monte Carlo simulations.

## üìå Objectives
- Dynamically control traffic lights based on vehicle density.
- Model real-time communication over LoRa between sensors and control unit.
- Evaluate network and system performance under varying traffic conditions.
- Simulate realistic vehicle arrivals using Poisson distribution.
- Analyze results for congestion control and communication efficiency.

## üß† Key Concepts

- **Poisson Distribution**: Simulates random vehicle arrivals over time.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Models probabilistic scenarios for signal timing and traffic flow.
- **Event-Based Simulation**: OMNeT++ is used to simulate discrete events such as arrivals, message transmissions, and traffic light changes.
- **FLoRa Framework**: Used for implementing LoRa communication between devices in the network.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

- **Vehicles**: Random arrivals, tracked with speed, position, and wait time.
- **Camera Sensors**: Detect vehicle counts every 5 seconds and transmit data via LoRa.
- **Control Unit (CU)**: Determines optimal traffic light states based on sensor data.
- **Traffic Lights**: Change dynamically based on decisions from the CU.
- **LoRa Nodes**: Enable wireless communication with delays and queuing.
